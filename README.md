# product_management_excercise
BACKGROUND:

Before starting the project's agenda, there are a few assumptions I need to put into place to play out the scenario.  There are a few questions I need to lay out and answer to set the framework:

Is the goal to improve the entire platform or a certain segment of it?  Assume the entire website needs to be updated, not just a segment of it.
What type of website is this?  Assume a real estate listings search website.
Is the legacy system responsive?  Assume no
Who are the personas / end-users of this website?  Assume consumes looking to buy a home, to simplify things.  Also assumes Agents looking to search for homes for their clients.
What are the pain points of the current system?  Assume it's non-responsive and slow.
What are the goals?  Make the website responsive, new UI, increase consumer engagement with the site.  I won't dive too deep into KPIs in this thought experiment.

I will also make assumptions that this project has been approved, funding and cost allocated, and it's green lit and set for development.  UI / UX and wireframes have been completed and approved.  MVP and scope has been established for the project.

Now having establish that, let's get to the kickoff.

KICKOFF AGENDA

1.  Go over the business objective - in summary - and client expectations for delivery.  We'll want to establish the end-goal for the project and take a more high-level view on what we're trying to accomplish here so everyone has an understanding and can get behind it.
2.  Go over the high-level wireframes and prototypes of the new property search website.  We don't need to go through screen by screen, by provide a high-level break-down on what we'll be building.  Broken down by:
   a.  New homepage design (desktop and mobile) that includes top navigation menus and a search bar
   b.  Search Results Page once consumers initiate the search (desktop and mobile)
   c.  Search Filters and Search Elements (Map, Options) etc. - despop and mobile
   d.  Landing Page for the Listing once consumers are ready to review, and the high-level elements of it.
3.  Review the breakdown of the work on the above screens.  Define roles and responsibilities with the team on both sides.  May include.
   a.  High-level stories created will be reviewed.
     i.  Note:  The stories I created are high level and generally I will break it down further after reviewing with our internal team and development has had a chance to further deep dive into it.
   b.  Front-end work required to build the site.  Will require coordination with back-end.
   c.  Back-end work required (connecting / creating new APIs, calls and other components for each page)
   d.  Art assets and other UX needed - what we have is a draft and further refinemenets will be needed
   e.  Content for the homepage, search results page and detail page to replace placeholder texts.  Articles and such required.
3.  Open up a discussion on the artifacts, APIs, assets, and other elements required from both our internal team and the client stakeholder team.
   a.  For example, the clients may want us to call to their servers and serve up results.  We'll need API information, etc. to complete the work.
4.  Discuss any blockers and dependencies required from both teams.  Identify those as blockers and prioritize them accordingly.
5.  Set a timeline to address blockers and/or any additional assets needed from the client team and internal team.
6.  Break out the agenda for the next few kick-off meetings so everyone will complete their action items (if any) prior to those meetings for the week.
7.  Summarize, review action items (who is clearly doing what), and kick-off the project.

NOTE:

Since this is a fairly large project, we'll focus on the Homepage for Sprint 0 and framework work required for subsequent sprints and pages.  I'll simplify things for time constraint purposes.  Assume this is how we've broken down the work in the kickoff and this is part of the project plan to kick things off.
